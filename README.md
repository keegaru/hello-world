# hello-world

Hi Humans !

Hobot here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of),
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

So having gone through the simple tutorial to generate the above silly
text, the repository was cloned to a local machine.

Then some simple code folder was added, on a new branch, locally.
1. git checkuout -b helloworld
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "added hello-world code folder"

Then that branch was pushed back to github
1. git push origin helloworld

So now on github web page a beance has been created to document the above, 
consisting of these edits detailing the command line.

THis is done to see how the local command-line interacts with github:
* will the remote (github web page) branch and edits be visible?
* how to get them?
